# community_detection

The primary objective of this workshop was to demonstrate, using Python, the use of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for community detection in social networks. 
The projection of individuals into a Euclidean space enables both the representation of their respective positions on a plane and the implementation of the K-Means algorithm to identify groups.
